## IDP Theme
IDP Themeï¼š Developing a Literature Research Tool that Automatically Search Literature and Summarize the Research Trends.

## Objective
In this IDP, we are going to develop a literature research tool that enables three functionalities:
1. Automatically search the most recent literature filtered by keywords on three literature platforms: Elvsier, IEEE and Google Scholar
2. Automatically summarize the most popular research directions and trends in  the searched literature from step 1
3. visualize the results from step 1 and step 2

## Correlation between the theoretical course and practical project
The accompanying theory courses *Machine Learning and Optimization* or *Machine Learning for Communication* teach basic and advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) knowledge.


The core part of the project, in my opinion, is the automatic summarization of research trends/directions of the papers, which can be modeled as a **Topic Modeling** task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This task requires machine learning and deep learning knowledge, such as word embeddings, transformers architecture, etc.

Therefore, I would like to take the Machine Learning and Optimization course or Machine learning for Communication course from EI department. And I think these theory courses should be necessary for a good ML/DL basis.
